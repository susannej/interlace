a simple and easy to use picture/photo management application, currently for my own requirements, to work closely with picturecodes Photo Ninja.

To compile the sourcecode, you currently need the following software-packages:
QT 4.8.3
exiv2 0.23

The sourcecode is currently developed under linux, but hopefully, on a later stable day, there will be a windows and mac-version, too.
